# Generative-AI-Incident-Triage-Copilot
Hello GitHub,
I was able to work on a proof-of-concept, AI-Powered Incident Triage Copilot.

🔍 What it does:

Reads alerts + log patterns across BigPanda, Dynatrace & Mainframe
Diagnoses the most likely root cause using LLM reasoning
Suggests fixes instantly (SQL checks, job reruns, data validations)
Notifies teams on MS Teams with a crisp, human-like summary
Cuts down the first 10 minutes of confusion to just 10 seconds

🧠 Why it matters:

In enterprise ops, time is money.
And every minute spent digging through logs is a minute the business loses availability.
This Copilot makes the entire triage process faster, smarter, and less chaotic.

🔧 Built Using:

Generative AI, Python, LangChain, Vector Search, CA7 APIs, Dynatrace Logs, BigPanda Alerts, Teams Integration.

This was just a PoC, but the idea is real, the impact is realer, and I’m excited to push this forward 🚀

If you’re curious, the full deck is attached.
Would love feedback from the community 👇✨
